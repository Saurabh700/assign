-> what is the difference between Props and State?

State is anything that changes on the DOM, and props are basically the properties that we pass to another component, it can be a method, array, object
state is mutable and props are immutable

-> useState()

useState is a hook in react that allows us to re-render any particular part/state on the dom without re-rendering the complete UI

-> map,filter,reduce

map,filter, and reduce all 3 are the operations in javascript that we can apply to any array so that we can get the desired output
map is used to iterate over an array, so that we can apply a function to every element of the array.
filter returns a new array with only those elements that satisfies the provided condition.
reduce returns the sum of the elements of the array
